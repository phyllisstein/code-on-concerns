> But nothing is gained---on the contrary!---by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the separation of concerns", which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focussing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.

## Deck
Keynote's export-to-HTML feature doesn't so much export to HTML as it does export to a series of PDFs wrapped _very_ unconvincingly in PDF.js. It's hideous. [Have fun](https://phyllisstein.github.io/code-on-concerns/)!
